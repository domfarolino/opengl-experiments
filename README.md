Repository accompanying me as I learn more about OpenGL, SDL, and GLEW

This repository will document my experience learning about building OpenGL programs in C++. For starters, I'm following [this](https://open.gl)
wonderful tutorial to help me get started. I'm following the guide on the path of using the Simple DirectMedia Library 2 (SDL2) to create nice
windows and respond to events from the OS, and GLEW to ensure the most modern OpenGL functions available at runtime are being used.

# Installation & Configuration

The process of installing the aforementioned dependencies (SDL2 and GLEW) vary on each platform. At the time of writing I'm using macOS Sierra
10.12.5, but given you have all necessary libraries installed properly the code (modulo the Makefile) should work just fine.
